        "designSummary": "**Luminaryforge: The Electric Forge - A Fusion of Brutalism and Cyberpunk**\n\nThe Vision: We're forging a digital experience that feels both cutting-edge and grounded. The core concept is 'Electric Forging' - a blend of raw, brutalist elements with the sleek, neon-lit aesthetic of cyberpunk. This creates a sense of powerful technology that is both accessible and undeniably cool.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Deconstructed Grid: A 12-column grid provides the underlying structure, but elements will intentionally break free, overlapping and extending beyond the grid lines to create a dynamic, layered feel.\n2. Typography as Code: Headlines will use a bold, geometric sans-serif (Space Grotesk), while body text will be set in a monospaced font (Azeret Mono) to evoke a sense of code and data.\n3. Electric Accents: The color palette will be dominated by a dark charcoal background, punctuated by a vibrant neon green accent color. Subtle gradients will add depth and visual interest.\n4. Glassmorphism and Thin Lines: Components will feature a 'glassmorphism' effect, creating a frosted-glass look with thin, glowing lines to define their edges. This adds a sense of depth and sophistication.",

The primary brand color is a vivid neon green, used boldly in large blocks, buttons, and accent elements to inject energy and a futuristic feel. Black is employed extensively for text and some background blocks, creating sharp contrast and clear visual hierarchy. Typography is clean, geometric sans-serif, with large, bold headings and smaller body text that maintains clarity and approachability. The layout is modular and asymmetrical yet balanced, with generous negative space and rounded corners on content blocks to soften the overall look. Simple geometric icons and repeated radial/starburst motifs in black and gray reinforce brand identity without clutter. Buttons are minimalistic, using neon green or black backgrounds with clear outlines and text. Overall, the design communicates a confident, innovative, and tech-savvy brand personality, suitable for professional services or consultancies focused on growth and modern solutions.",

This creates a sense of powerful technology that is both accessible and undeniably cool.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Deconstructed Grid: A 12-column grid provides the underlying structure, but elements will intentionally break free, overlapping and extending beyond the grid lines to create a dynamic, layered feel.\n2. Typography as Code: Headlines will use a bold, geometric sans-serif (Space Grotesk), while body text will be set in a monospaced font (Azeret Mono) to evoke a sense of code and data.\n3. Electric Accents: The color palette will be dominated by a dark charcoal background, punctuated by a vibrant neon green accent color. Subtle gradients will add depth and visual interest.\n4. Glassmorphism and Thin Lines: Components will feature a 'glassmorphism' effect, creating a frosted-glass look with thin, glowing lines to define their edges. This adds a sense of depth and sophistication.",
